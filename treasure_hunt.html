                <p>Happy Valentine's Day baby! The purpose of this message is not to tell you how much I love you or how you make me feel but just to talk. I wrote many great things for this message initially but then I deleted it (You wouldn't be able to understand the words I would've used). So I decided to just raw dog this one. I will yap and you will listen.</p>
                <p>You are great at something because you are obsessed with it. You are passionate about it. This obsession is a prerequisite. I love Saivya because I am obssessed with her. Remove Saivya from the equation and I'd just be plain french fries. She's the salt, mayonaisse, peri peri that gives flavour to my life.</p>
                <p>A foreign key is something that gives a dependent entity its identity. I am a dependent entity and you are my foreign key. Without Saivya, there's no Vivan.</p>
                <p>Roll number 24 is Nidhi, 25 is Padmanabh, and 26 is Saivya's Vivan. </p>
                <p>Call me multiple inheritance because I cannot exist without an interface like you. </p>
                <p>There are 5 dimensions in the wormhole - height, width, breadth, time and Saivya. </p>
                <p>I sometimes wonder what my life would be like without you. And then I go to sleep because it is too tough. When you're happy, I'm happy and when you're sad, I'm sad. Maybe that's love, maybe it's not, but it's 100% nothing compared to how much I love your mom. </p>
                <p>I promise this was all me. No chatgpt. I thought I was not creative and I was right. But this was hella fun. <p>
                <p> I love you my princess. You're everything I need. </p>
                <p>I am not Vivan. I am</p>
                <p><strong>Saivya's</strong></p>
                <p>Vivan</p>`;
